                    <p>1.The game consists of a set of alphabet images and an empty word container.</p>
                    <p>2.The alphabet images are draggable and can be moved by clicking and dragging them</p>
                    <p>3.The player's task is to match the correct word to the displayed alphabet image by dragging and
                        dropping the image over the empty word container.</p>
                    <p>4.Each time an alphabet image is dropped, the game checks if the word matches the correct word
                        for that alphabet.</p>
                    <p>5.If the word matches correctly, the word container will be filled with the word, and the next
                        alphabet image will appear.</p>
                    <p>6.If the word does not match the correct word for the alphabet, the image will return to its
                        original position, and the player can try again.</p>
                    <p>7.The game continues until all alphabet images have been matched with their correct words.</p>
